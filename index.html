          <p>I am a mechanical engineer, web developer, and newbie software engineer. I originally thought working in the medical field was the right choice for me but realized my true passion lies in the field of engineering.  I live in Evanston and currently work under Tim Yang at the <a href="https://barnett.northwestern.edu/" target="_blank">Barnett Research Group</a>. My research there focuses on synthesizing new electrolyte material in hopes that it produces higher conductivity in lower operating temperatures for a typical solid oxide fuel cell. Follow our group on Instagram
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/barnettgroup/" alt="instagram"><i class="fab fa-instagram"></i></a>. More activities are documented in my <a href="documents/CV.pdf" target="_blank">resume.</a> </p>
          <p>Aside from my involvement and interest in the energy department. My interests span, web development, app development and CAD design. I love designing, making everything look aesthetically pleasing but also ensuring its functionality. My passion for designing has led me to be a part of a team competing in the White Space Challenge this year. Stay Tuned! </p>
          <p>When I'm not working you're likely to find me watching Netflix (The Witcher is awesome), playing games with friends <br>(League, Hearthstone &#127918;), or eating my way through Chicago and its surrounding cities. &#127832; </p>
